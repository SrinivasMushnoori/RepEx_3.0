SuperMIC at LSU (Open for general use) 

23-Sep-2014

SuperMIC is a 1.08 PetaFlop Peak Performance Xeon Phi accelerated cluster.  SuperMIC
has 360 nodes each with 20 Intel Ivybridge 2.8 GHz cores, 64 GB of RAM, and two 
Intel Xeon Phi 7120P co-processors. There are 20 nodes that have NVIDIA K20X GPUs.
This cluster is 40% allocated to the XSEDE user community an 60% dedicated to
authorized users of the LSU community.  Access is restricted to those who meet 
the criteria as stated on our website.

Quotas for the /home volume are enabled at 5 GB.  Please do
not use the /home volume for batch job I/O, use the /work volume 
instead.  Please limit the number of files per directory to 10,000.
No disk GB quotas are in effect for the /work volume, but files are purged that 
are older than 60 days.  There are quotas on file counts.  Manage your files,
but it is against our policy to blatantly circumvent the purge procedure.  
Misconfigured jobs that are wasting CPU resources are subject to deletion.
